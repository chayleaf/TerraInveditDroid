## FAQ

Q: What is your Android version?  
A: You'll need to use 4.0.1 or above. Sorry 2.3 users :(

Q: Are you using a custom ROM, or custom kernel?  
A: If yes, then that fancyness doesn't support my über-simple code

Q: What is your SuperSU version?  
A: I have SuperSU 2.46

Q: Is "Mount namespace separation" turned off?  
A: If not, turn it off, and reboot

Q: What is your Busybox version? Have you tried updating it?  
A: I have 1.23.1 installed using [the market](market://stericson.busybox) Just press "Install", and it'll install it.
NOTE: It has a VERY, VERY LOW chance that it'll softbrick your device, so be careful.

Q: I get the error:
```
java.lang.RuntimeException: Unable to start activity ComponentInfo{MarcusD.TerraInvedit/Marcu­sD.TerraInvedit.InveditActivity}: java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException­: length=0; index=89
```
A: If you did all the above, and this is still happening, then you're out of luck, sorry :( I'll update this soon, so check back for an update :)

## More Notes

> This wont work on devices with SEAndroid (like galaxy s4), because SEAndroid is way too Security Enhanced :P

> If you do a backup, please make sure that all .player files have this format: `playername-##########.player` (where # is a digit, and yes, that's 10digits)
